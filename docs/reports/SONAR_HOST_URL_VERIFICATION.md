# SONAR_HOST_URL Verification Report

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Issue:** Code review advisory about SONAR_HOST_URL environment variable  
**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED - No changes required

## Issue Description

A code review tool flagged the following advisory:

> The SONAR_HOST_URL environment variable is not needed when using the SonarCloud GitHub action, as it defaults to SonarCloud. This variable is typically used for self-hosted SonarQube instances.

**File:** `.github/workflows/build.yml`  
**Line:** 36  
**Category:** code-review  
**Severity:** medium

## Verification Results

### ✅ Workflow Configuration is Correct

The `.github/workflows/build.yml` file is already properly configured for SonarCloud:

1. **Correct Action**: Uses `SonarSource/sonarcloud-github-action@master`
   - This is the correct action for SonarCloud (cloud-based service)
   - NOT using `SonarSource/sonarqube-scan-action` (which is for self-hosted SonarQube)

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - ✅ `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Present (required for PR analysis)
   - ✅ `SONAR_TOKEN`: Present (required for authentication)
   - ✅ `SONAR_HOST_URL`: **NOT present** (correct for SonarCloud)

3. **YAML Syntax**: Valid

### Why SONAR_HOST_URL is Not Needed

`SONAR_HOST_URL` is only required for **self-hosted SonarQube** instances where you need to specify the URL of your SonarQube server.

For **SonarCloud** (the cloud-based service):

- The action automatically defaults to `https://sonarcloud.io`
- Setting `SONAR_HOST_URL` is unnecessary and redundant
- The configuration is correct without it

### Documentation Consistency

The repository documentation in `docs/SONARCLOUD_SETUP.md` correctly states:

| Feature       | SonarQube (On-Premise)      | SonarCloud (Cloud)              |
| ------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| GitHub Action | `sonarqube-scan-action`     | `sonarcloud-github-action`      |
| Host URL      | Required (`SONAR_HOST_URL`) | Not needed (uses sonarcloud.io) |

## Conclusion

**No changes are required.** The workflow is already correctly configured according to SonarCloud best practices:

- ✅ Using the correct SonarCloud GitHub action
- ✅ SONAR_HOST_URL is appropriately absent
- ✅ All required environment variables are present
- ✅ Configuration matches documentation

The code review advisory appears to be an informational notice confirming that the configuration follows best practices, rather than indicating an issue that needs to be fixed.
