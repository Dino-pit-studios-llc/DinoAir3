# GitHub Actions Permissions Update

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Task:** Add workflow-level permissions to GitHub Actions workflows
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary

Updated `.github/workflows/build.yml` to include explicit workflow-level permissions following GitHub Actions security best practices.

## Change Details

### File: `.github/workflows/build.yml`

**Added:**

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
```

This change adds workflow-level permissions that apply to all jobs in the workflow by default, following the principle of least privilege.

## Security Benefits

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: The workflow now explicitly declares minimal default permissions (contents: read only)
2. **Explicit Permissions**: Removes reliance on GitHub's default permissions, which are more permissive
3. **Future-Proofing**: If additional jobs are added to the workflow, they will inherit the restrictive default permissions rather than the more permissive GitHub defaults
4. **Job-Level Override**: The sonarcloud job retains its job-level permissions (contents: read, pull-requests: read) which override the workflow-level permissions for that specific job

## Workflow Permissions Structure

### Before:

```yaml
jobs:
  sonarcloud:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: read
```

- Only job-level permissions declared
- Other jobs would inherit GitHub's default permissions (more permissive)

### After:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  sonarcloud:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: read
```

- Workflow-level permissions provide restrictive baseline
- Jobs can override with specific permissions as needed
- Follows security best practices

## Verification

- ✅ YAML syntax validated with Python YAML parser
- ✅ Workflow follows GitHub Actions security best practices
- ✅ Minimal change - only 4 lines added
- ✅ No functional changes to workflow behavior
- ✅ Principle of least privilege applied

- `.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml` - ✅ Already has workflow-level permissions
