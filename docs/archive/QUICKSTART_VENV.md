# 🚀 Quick Start: Virtual Environment Auto-Activation

## ✅ Setup Complete!

Your VS Code is now configured to automatically activate the Python virtual environment.

## 🔒 NEW: Global Pip Protection Enabled!

Global pip installations are now BLOCKED system-wide. You must activate a virtual environment to install packages. This prevents accidents!

```powershell
# Without venv - BLOCKED ✖
pip install requests
# ERROR: Could not find an activated virtualenv (required).

# With venv - WORKS ✅
(.venv) PS> pip install requests
# Success!
```

## 🎯 Next Step: Restart VS Code

1. Close all VS Code windows
2. Reopen VS Code
3. Open a new terminal (Ctrl+Shift+`)
4. You should see `(.venv)` at the start of your prompt!

```powershell
(.venv) PS C:\Users\kevin\DinoAir3>
```

## ✨ What You Get

- ✅ Auto-activation
