### Configuration Highlights

**Coverage Measurement (.coveragerc)**

- ✅ Branch coverage enabled
- ✅ Exclusions configured (tests, venv, migrations, cache)
- ✅ Multiple report formats (XML, HTML, JSON, Terminal)
- ✅ Pragma comments for excluding lines (`# pragma: no cover`)
- ✅ Quality thresholds ready (currently set to 0, increase gradually)

**Codacy Integration (.codacy.yml)**

- ✅ Coverage reporting enabled
- ✅ Multiple engines configured (pylint, bandit, prospector, metrics)
- ✅ Duplication detection enabled
- ✅ File exclusions aligned with .coveragerc
- ✅ Quality gates configured

**SonarCloud (sonar-project.properties)**

- ✅ Project key: DinoPitStudios-org_DinoAir3
- ✅ Organization: dinopitstudios-llc
- ✅ Coverage report paths configured
- ✅ Python 3.11 specified
- ✅ Exclusions for tests and generated code

**GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/coverage.yml)**

- ✅ Runs on push (main/master/features) and PRs
- ✅ Python 3.11 matrix
- ✅ Installs all project dependencies
- ✅ Generates coverage.xml and HTML reports
- ✅ Uploads to Codacy Coverage Reporter
- ✅ Sends analysis to SonarCloud
- ✅ Posts PR comments with coverage summary
- ✅ Stores artifacts for 30 days
- ✅ Security: Actions pinned to commit SHAs

## 🔐 Security Improvements

During setup, Codacy analysis identified security considerations:

1. **GitHub Actions Pinning**:
   - ✅ Official GitHub actions (checkout, setup-python, upload/download-artifact) pinned to commit SHAs
   - ℹ️ Third-party actions (SonarCloud, coverage-comment) use version tags for reliability
   - **Rationale**: Commit SHAs were not accessible via GitHub API for these actions
   - **Mitigation**: Using official, trusted actions with semantic versions
   - See `.github/ACTION_VERSION_PINNING.md` for detailed decision rationale

2. ℹ️ **False Positive**: Commit SHA detected as SonarQube API key (safe to ignore)

## 📋 Required Action Items

### 1. GitHub Secrets Configuration ⚠️ REQUIRED

You must add these secrets before the workflow will function:

**CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN**

```
1. Visit: https://app.codacy.com/gh/DinoPitStudios-org/DinoAir3/settings
2. Go to: Integrations → Project API
3. Copy the token
4. Add to: https://github.com/DinoPitStudios-org/DinoAir3/settings/secrets/actions
   - Name: CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN
   - Value: [paste token]
```

**SONAR_TOKEN**

```
1. Visit: https://sonarcloud.io/account/security
2. Generate new token (name: "DinoAir3-GitHub-Actions")
3. Copy the token
4. Add to: https://github.com/DinoPitStudios-org/DinoAir3/settings/secrets/actions
   - Name: SONAR_TOKEN
   - Value: [paste token]
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov pytest-asyncio pytest-mock
```

### 3. Test Locally

**Windows:**

```powershell
.\run-coverage.ps1
```

**Linux/Mac:**

```bash
chmod +x run-coverage.sh
./run-coverage.sh
```

**Manual:**

```bash
pytest --cov --cov-report=html --cov-report=term
```

### 4. Verify HTML Report

```bash
# Windows
start htmlcov\index.html

# Mac
open htmlcov/index.html

# Linux
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html
```

## 🎯 Coverage Goals

Start conservative and increase gradually:

| Metric           | Initial | Short-term | Long-term |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Overall Coverage | Current | 60%        | 80%       |
| New Code         | Current | 70%        | 90%       |
| Critical Paths   | Current | 75%        | 95%       |
| API Routes       | Current | 65%        | 85%       |
| Database         | Current | 65%        | 85%       |

### Adjusting Thresholds

Edit `.coveragerc`:

```ini
[coverage:report]
fail_under = 60  # Increase gradually: 60 → 70 → 80
```

## 🔄 Workflow Behavior

### Automatic Triggers

- ✅ Push to `main`, `master`, or `features` branches
- ✅ Pull requests to `main` or `master`
- ✅ Manual dispatch from GitHub Actions tab

### What Happens

1. Sets up Python 3.11
2. Installs all dependencies (including API, tests, dev requirements)
3. Runs pytest with coverage
4. Generates coverage.xml (for tools) and htmlcov/ (for browsing)
5. Displays coverage summary in workflow output
6. Uploads coverage to Codacy
7. Sends analysis to SonarCloud
8. Posts coverage comment on PR (if applicable)
9. Uploads artifacts (available for 30 days)

### Error Handling

- Tests failures: Workflow continues (coverage still useful)
- Codacy upload fails: Workflow continues
- SonarCloud fails: Workflow continues
- All failures are logged but don't block the workflow

## 📊 Viewing Results

### Local HTML Report

- Path: `htmlcov/index.html`
- Shows: Line-by-line coverage, branch coverage, missing lines
- Updates: Every time you run coverage

### Codacy Dashboard

- URL: https://app.codacy.com/gh/DinoPitStudios-org/DinoAir3
- Shows: Coverage trends, quality gates, issues
- Updates: On every push/PR via GitHub Actions

### SonarCloud Dashboard

- URL: https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=DinoPitStudios-org_DinoAir3
- Shows: Coverage, code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, security hotspots
- Updates: On every push/PR via GitHub Actions

### GitHub PR Comments

- Shows: Coverage percentage, change in coverage
- Compares: Current PR vs base branch
- Highlights: New uncovered code

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflow Fails: "pytest: command not found"

```bash
pip install pytest pytest-cov
```

### Workflow Fails: "CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN not found"

- Add secret in GitHub repository settings
- See "Required Action Items" section above

### Workflow Fails: "coverage.xml not found"

- Check pytest ran successfully
- Verify `--cov` flag is present
- Check `.coveragerc` exists

### Coverage Seems Low

- Review `htmlcov/index.html` to identify gaps
- Check `.coveragerc` exclusions aren't too broad
- Verify tests are actually running (check workflow logs)

### Can't View HTML Report Locally

```bash
# Generate it first
pytest --cov --cov-report=html

# Then open
start htmlcov\index.html  # Windows
open htmlcov/index.html   # Mac
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html  # Linux
```
