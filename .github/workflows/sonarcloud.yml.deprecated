# DEPRECATED: This workflow has been consolidated into ci.yml
# 
# The SonarCloud analysis job is now part of the unified CI/CD pipeline.
# To configure SonarCloud:
# 1. Set SONAR_TOKEN secret in GitHub repository settings
# 2. Verify sonar-project.properties has correct org and projectKey
# 3. The analysis runs automatically on push and pull requests
#
# See: .github/workflows/ci.yml (sonarcloud job)
